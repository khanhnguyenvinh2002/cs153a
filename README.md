Elevator pitch:
Don’t know what major is suitable for you? Do you want to do a major but are afraid that might be a wrong decision? You had an interesting course but don’t know if that is the right major to take? FindMyMajor is here to help you save your college life. Our product provides a service that can be called a diary/journal for students undecided or decided to note down their experience of taking different classes for the different semesters and provide a thorough analysis of the pros and cons of the major and how it suits their interest based on self-ratings and weekly experience. Moreover, this can also be used to connect better the school’s academic service with the student by suggesting which course one might want to take to fully understand what the major is about. If after a course and the student still cannot decide, the advisors can suggest more resources/ courses the student can take to decide better.
